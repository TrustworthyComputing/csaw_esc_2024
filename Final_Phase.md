# Final Phase

Welcome to the finals phase for CSAW ESC'24! This page will provide additional details about the finals. You will need the following items:

 - The provided ESC hardware kit that includes: Arduino Uno v3 compatible board, USB cable, DC motor drive shield with external 12V power input, 12V 350mA stepper motor, 12V DC motor (fan), 360 control angle servo motor, 12V 2A power supply;
 - A computer with a standard USB port;
 - [avrdude](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) software running on the computer;
 - A serial port interface (such as minicom), with 115200 baud rate to communicate with the board at the corresponding port (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0).

A short video with assembly instructions for the ESC hardware is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DRpB7Qy6YpE_sjXaRERW-EI_ULjzWqRX/view?usp=drive_link).

> Please note: It is important to **never** connect the 12 Volt power supply to the Arduino board while it is connected to a computer via USB -- this will damage the computer port!
> 
> Instead, the stripped wires of the power supply should only be connected to power port of motor shield (with the jumper removed) as shown in the video tutorial.


## Challenge Structure Overview

Throughout the next few weeks **new challenges will be released**. The points from all challenges will be
accumulated in the final score of each team. Challenges will be given a different number of points based upon their difficulties.


## Submission Details
For information about the deliverables of the final phase you can visit [this page](https://github.com/TrustworthyComputing/csaw_esc_2024/blob/main/deliverables.md).

## Verifying Solutions
The challenge leaders will verify the solutions that each team has submitted before the final presentations. Every team should also include  in the final report the verification flag received when a challenge is solved.
