Welcome to Week 3! For this week, we return to the Arduino Boards for some more motor challenges. 


### Lizzy (200 points)

Tickets to ride have already been purchased. The night before, we boarded a passenger ship departing from the Gulf of Tokin,  leaving behind everything we knew. Yesterday, oh now I long for yesterday. Another girl takes a seat next to us aboard the cramped quarters as we pass through an enemy war zone. It's only loveless journey now.  I've just seen the face of an enemy war ship in the distance, with a steel motor contraption waving an encoded signal. Tell me what you see. You've got to hide your identity away. Act naturally and respond to the message. You're going to lose that girl if you don't. You like me too much to let that happen. Help! I need you.
