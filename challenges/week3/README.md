Welcome to Week 3! For this week, we return to the Arduino Boards for some more motor challenges. 


### Lizzy (200 points)

Tickets to ride have already been purchased. The night before, we boarded a passenger ship departing from the Gulf of Tokin,  leaving behind everything we knew. Yesterday, oh now I long for yesterday. Another girl takes a seet next to us aboard the cramped quarters as we pass through an enemy war zone. Its only loveless journey now.  I've just seen the face a enemy war ship in the distance, with a steel motor contraption waving an encoded signal. Tell me what you see. You've got to hide your indentity away. Act naturally and respond to the message. You're going to lose that girl if you dont. You like me too much to let that happen. Help! I need you.
