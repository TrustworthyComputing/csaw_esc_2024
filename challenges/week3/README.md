Welcome to Week 3! For this week, we return to the Arduino Boards for some more motor challenges. 


### Lizzy (200 points)

Tickets to ride have already been purchased. The night before, we boarded a passenger ship departing from the Gulf of Tokin,  leaving behind everything we knew. Yesterday, oh now I long for yesterday. Another girl takes a seat next to us aboard the cramped quarters as we pass through an enemy war zone. It's only loveless journey now.  I've just seen the face of an enemy war ship in the distance, with a steel motor contraption waving an encoded signal. Tell me what you see. You've got to hide your identity away. Act naturally and respond to the message. You're going to lose that girl if you don't. You like me too much to let that happen. Help! I need you.

### Fast & Max (200 points)

In the down town of a bustling metropolis, there is a bank that has a secret chamber that contains a treasure of immense value. A witty group of 17 thieves, called Fast&Max, are trying to break into this chamber. However, this chamber is protected by two safes, each safe has its own sophisticated mechanism designed the banks engineers. 
The key to unlocking the first safe lies in obtaining a 16-digit employee ID number. The ID is encoded with RSA-like encryption.  
To unlock the second safe, a well-crafted bank PIN of alphabetic characters will make the safe combination lock to rotate to reveal the hidden treasures.

*Note: Reverse Engineering is allowed for this challenge only, on the FastMax_Dummy.hex binary, to understand the code logic. The challenges must still be solved utilizing side channels on motor acoustics.*
