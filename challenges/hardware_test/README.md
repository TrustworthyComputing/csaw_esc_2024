## Hardware Test Files

These programs can be used to test the hardware. 
A short video with assembly instructions for the ESC hardware is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DRpB7Qy6YpE_sjXaRERW-EI_ULjzWqRX/view?usp=drive_link).

> Please note: It is important to **never** connect the 12 Volt power supply to the Arduino board while it is connected to a computer via USB -- this will damage the computer port!
> 
> Instead, the stripped wires of the power supply should only be connected to power port of motor shield (with the jumper removed) as shown in the video tutorial.
