You find yourself in a dimly lit workshop filled with various mechanical contraptions, gears, and old tools. In the center of the room stands a large, vintage music box adorned with intricate carvings. Beside it is a combination lock, indicating that the music box is actually a safe. Above the music box, a sign reads, “Listen closely; the answer lies within.”, along with a USB with some code and sound recordings. Can you break into to music box?

This is a standard lock that requires 3 simple turns.

This lock is more complicated, where it matter not only how much you turn the dial, but *how* you turn it. Can you rise to the challenge?
